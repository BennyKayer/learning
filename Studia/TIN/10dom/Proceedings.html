Such event data are the starting point for process mining --
an emerging scientific discipline relating modeled and observed behavior.
The relevance of process mining is increasing as
more and more event data become available.
The increasing volume of such data (``Big Data&#39;&#39;) provides both opportunities
and challenges for process mining.
In this paper we focus on two particular types of process mining:
\emph{process discovery} (learning a process model from example behavior
recorded in an event log) and \emph{conformance checking} (diagnosing and
quantifying discrepancies between observed behavior and modeled behavior).
These tasks become challenging when there are hundreds or even thousands of different activities
and millions of cases.
Typically, process mining algorithms are linear in the number of cases and exponential
in the number of different activities.
This paper proposes a very general divide-and-conquer approach that decomposes
the event log based on a partitioning of activities.
Unlike existing approaches,  this paper does not assume a particular process representation (e.g., Petri nets or BPMN) and allows
for various decomposition strategies (e.g., SESE- or passage-based decomposition).
Moreover, the generic divide-and-conquer approach reveals the core requirements for
decomposing process discovery and conformance checking problems.">A General Divide and Conquer Approach for Process Mining</a>

This presentation compares the method with other popular matrix decomposition approaches for various pattern analysis tasks. Among others, NMF has been also widely applied for clustering and latent feature extraction. Several types of the objective functions have been used for NMF in the literature.  Instead of minimizing the common Euclidean Distance (EucD) error, we review an alternative method that maximizes the correntropy similarity measure to produce the factorization. Correntropy is an entropy-based criterion defined as a nonlinear similarity measure. Following the discussion of maximization of the correntropy function, we use it to cluster document data set and compare the clustering performance with the EucD-based NMF.  Our approach was applied and illustrated for the clustering of documents in the 20-Newsgroups data set. The comparison is illustrated with 20-Newsgroups data set. The results show that our approach produces per average better clustering compared with other methods which use EucD as an objective function.">Nonnegative Matrix Factorization and Its Application to Pattern Analysis and Text Mining</a>

Moreover, the proposed approach is applicable in the case of separating I+3 sources from I mixtures without additive noise. This situation is more challenging and suitable to practical real world problems. Also, the sparsity conditions are not imposed unlike to those employed by some conventional approaches. Firstly, the number of source signals are estimated followed by the estimation of the mixing matrix based on the use of short time Fourier transform and rough-fuzzy clustering. Then, source signals are normalized and recovered using modified Lin&#39;s projected gradient algorithm with modified Armijo rule. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can separate I+3 source signals from I mixed signals, and it has superior evaluation performance compared to conventional approaches.">Underdetermined Blind Separation of an Unknown Number of Sources Based on Fourier Transform and Matrix Factorization</a>

It is an ant colony optimisation approach that uses pheromones to mark paths linking objects that are similar and potentially members of the same cluster or class. Its novelty is in the way it uses separate pheromones for each descriptive attribute of the object rather than a single pheromone representing the whole object. Ants that encounter other ants frequently enough can combine the attribute values they are detecting, which enables the MPACA to learn influential variable interactions. This paper applies the model to real-world data from two domains. One is logistics, focusing on resource allocation rather than the more traditional vehicle-routing problem. The other is mental-health risk assessment. The task for the MPACA in each domain was to predict class membership where the classes for the logistics domain were the levels of demand on haulage company resources and the mental-health classes were levels of suicide risk. Results on these noisy real-world data were promising, demonstrating the ability of the MPACA to find patterns in the data with accuracy comparable to more traditional linear regression models.">The Multiple Pheromone Ant Clustering Algorithm and its application to real world domains</a>

These fuzzy functions rely on the lower and upper approximations of a set. They provide special type of fuzziness on the universe: all of them are partial functions and derived from the observed data relatively to available knowledge about the objects of the universe. With the help of these functions, three new approximation pairs are generated and so new approximation spaces appear effectively. Using not Pawlakian approximation pairs gives a special insight into the nature of general set approximations, and so new models of necessity and possibility can be given.">Fuzziness in Partial Approximation Framework</a>

It is important source of information about image content, especially for single-band images. In this paper we present the results of research carried out to assess the usefulness of selected textural features of different groups in panchromatic very high resolution (VHR) satellite image classification. The study is based on images obtained from EROS A satellite. The aim of our tests was to estimate and compare the accuracy of main land cover types classification, with a particular focus on determining usefulness of textural features based on multifractal formalism. 
Presented research confirmed that it is possible to use the textural features as efficient global descriptors of VHR satellite image content. It was also prove that multifractal parameters should be considered as valuable textural features in the context of land cover classification.">Comparison of Selected Textural Features as Global Content-Based Descriptors of VHR Satellite Image – the EROS-A Study</a>

Heart, being a magnificent pump, has his performance orchestrated via a group of valves and highly sophisticated neural control. While the kinetics of the heart is accompanied by sound production, sound waves produced, by the heart, are reliable diagnostic tools to check heart activity.  Chronologically, several data sets have been put forward to sneak on the heart performance and lead to medical intervention whenever necessary.  The heart sounds data set, utilized in this paper, provides researchers with abundance of sound signals that was classified using different classification algorithms; decision tree, rotation forest, random forest are few to mention. 
   This paper proposes an approach based on local transfer function classifier as a new model of neural networks for heart valve diseases detection. In order to achieve this objective, and to increase the efficiency of the predication model, boolean reasoning discretization algorithm is introduced to discretion the heart signal data set, then the rough set reduction technique is applied to find all reducts of the data which contains the minimal subset of attributes that are associated with a class label for classification. Then, the rough sets dependency rules are generated directly from all generated reducts. Rough confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the predicted reducts and classes. Finally, a  local transfer function classifier was employed to evaluate the ability of the selected  descriptors for discrimination  whether they represent healthy or unhealthy.  The experimental results obtained, show that the overall accuracy offered by the employed local transfer function classifier
was high compared with other techniques including decision table, rotation forest, random forest,  and NBtree.">Cardiac disorders detection approach based on local transfer function classifier</a>

The basics and key features of our collision control algorithm are discussed to include practical examinations. Our approach is based on multi-agent systems and help moving agents to pursue their goals using collision free routes. In terms of validating our solution, we plan to apply into a configuration set of agents located in our experimental space. We also explain our solution algorithm that we have developed, along with the examination that we subjected it to, as well as sketching some of the most important challenges that remain to be addresses in our future researches.">A Human Inspired Collision Avoidance Strategy for Moving Agents</a>

Each of the incidents is reported in a database and characterized by a set of quantitative attributes and by natural language descriptions of the cause, the scene and the course of actions undergone by firefighters. The training set for our experiments was manually labeled by the Fire Service commanders after deeper analysis of the emergency description. We also introduce a modified version of Explicit Semantic Analysis method and demonstrate how it can be employed for automatic labeling of the incident reports. The task we are trying to accomplish belongs to the multi-label classification problems. Its practical purpose is to support the commanders at a emergency scene and improve the analytics on the data collected by Polish State Fire Service.">Semantic Tagging of Heterogeneous Data: Labeling Fire &amp; Rescue Incidents with Threats</a>

Due to the high-dimensionality and complexity of the data, it is impossible to analyze it manually. Therefore machine learning techniques play an important role in dealing with such data. In this paper we propose to use a one-class approach to classifying microarrays. Unlike canonical classifiers, these models rely only on objects coming from single class distributions. They distinguish observations coming from the given class from any other possible states of the object, that were unseen during the classification step. While having less information to dichotomize between classes, one-class  models can easily learn the specific properties of a given dataset and are robust to difficulties embedded in the nature of the data. We show, that using one-class support vector machines can give as good results as canonical multi-class classifiers, while allowing to deal with imbalanced distribution and unexpected noise in the data. To cope with high dimensionality of the feature space, we propose to form an ensemble, based on Random Subspace and prune it with the usage of diversity measure. Experimental investigations, carried on public datasets, prove the usefulness of the proposed approach.">Combining One-Class Support Vector Machines for Microarray Classification</a>

The model describes spam subclasses and brings information about major features of a spam detection task. The model is the base for decision trees that detect spam. The analysis of detectors, which was learned from data collected from different mail servers, results in the universal spam description consists of the most significant features.

solve multi–class problems. One of proposed ensemble structure
is a directed acyclic graph. In this structure, a classifier is created
for each pair of classes. The number of classifiers can be reduced
if groups of classes will be separated instead of individual classes.
The proposed method is based on the similarity of classes defined
as a distance between classes. For near classes the structure of
DAG stays immutable. For the distant classes more than one
is separated with a single classifier. In this paper, the proposed
method is tested in variants based on various metrics. For the
tests, several datasets from UCI repository was used and the
results were compared with published works. The tests proved
that grouping of radial basis functions into such ensemble reduces
the classification cost and the recognition accuracy is not reduced
significantly.">RBF ensemble based on reduction of DAG structure</a>

these models. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness
and the reliability of the proposed recommender system. Based on
the data resulted, the average Ozone level prediction in a certain

developing novel methods for extraction of knowledge among multiple collaborative agents. This
paper extends on this combination, and motivated by the work of Nix and Kantarcioglu employs the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to achieve privacy-preserving collaborative classification.
Specifically, in addition to encouraging multiple agents to share data truthfully, we facilitate
preservation of privacy. In our model, privacy is accomplished by allowing the parties to supply a
controlled amount of perturbed data, instead of randomised data, so long as this perturbation does
not harm the overall result of classification. The critical point which determines when this
perturbation is harmful is given by the VCG mechanism. Our experiment on real data confirms the
potential of the theoretical model, in the sense that VCG mechanism can balance the tradeoff
between privacy preservation and good data mining results.">Vickrey-Clarke-Groves for privacy-preserving collaborative classification</a>

Experiments have been performed using artificially created dataset instances, based on real--world instances. Obtained results prove that such methods stand interesting feature that can be included to more complex methods and increase their robustness.">Novel heuristic solutions for Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem</a>

In this paper we describe components of an event recognition system building up a full processing chain from low-level features extraction to high-level semantic information on detected events. It is comprised of three components: object detection and tracking algorithms, a fuzzy ontology and Fuzzy Semantic Petri Nets (FSPN), a formalism that can be used to specify events and to reason on their occurrence.  FSPN are Petri nets coupled with an underlying fuzzy ontology. The ontology stores  assertions (facts) concerning object classification and detected relations being an abstraction of the information originating from object tracking algorithms. Fuzzy predicates querying the ontology are used in Petri net transitions guards. Places in FSPN represent scenario steps. Tokens carry information on objects participating in an event and have weights expressing likelihood of an event&#39;s step occurrence. 
Introduced fuzziness allow to cope with imprecise information delivered by image analysis algorithms. We describe the architecture of video event recognition system and show examples of successfully recognized events.">Object Tracking and Video Event Recognition with Fuzzy Semantic Petri Nets</a>

The method used in the system for diagnosing Down&#39;s syndrome in infants is based on the combination of text knowledge found in the scientific literature describing Down&#39;s syndrome with the knowledge obtained from the analysis of dermatoglyphic indices characteristic of Down&#39;s syndrome with the use of digital pattern recognition techniques. The scientific goal is to design a classifier system that realizes automatic medical diagnosis through the application of an expert system designed on the basis of knowledge included in the scientific text descriptions of the Down&#39;s syndrome. One other aim is the application of the pattern recognition algorithms to the analysis of indices present in the images of dermatoglyphic patterns. This approach, similar to the approach used by anthropologists, is realized by the system through the juxtaposition of the knowledge described in the form of expert system rules and the information provided by the appropriate digital equipment, and on the basis of this juxtaposition an arbitrary classification of the investigated patterns is performed.">Medical Decision Support System Architecture for Diagnosis of Down's Syndrome</a>

in the world. Transplantation and tumor resection are two
main therapies in common clinical practice. Both tasks need
image assisted planning and quantitative evaluations. An efficient
and effective automatic liver segmentation is required for
corresponding quantitative evaluations. Computed Tomography
(CT) is highly accurate for liver cancer diagnosis. Manual
identification of hepatic lesions done by trained physicians is
a time-consuming task and can be subjective depending on
the skill, expertise and experience of the physician. Computer
aided segmentation of CT images would thus be a great step
forward to scientific advancement for medical purposes. The
sophisticated hybrid system was proposed in this paper which is
capable to segment liver from abdominal CT and detect hepatic
lesions automatically. The proposed system based on two different
datasets and experimental results show that the proposed system
robust, fastest and effectively detect the presence of lesions in
the liver, count the distinctly identifiable lesions and compute
the area of liver affected as tumors lesion, and provided good
quality results, which could segment liver and extract lesions
from abdominal CT in less than 0.15 s/slice.">Automatic computer aided segmentation for liver and hepatic lesions using hybrid segmentations techniques</a>

The early detection can be achieved by automatic segmentation of retinal blood vessels in retinal images which is two-class classification problem. This paper proposes two improvements in previous approach uses ant colony system for automatic segmentation of retinal blood vessels. The first improvement is done by adding new discriminant feature to the features pool used in classification. The second improvement is done by applying new heuristic function based on probability theory in the ant colony system instead of the old that based on Euclidean distance used before.

Additionally, different approaches to signal definitions and preprocessing are discussed and tested. 
To verify which of the methods presented is more accurate in case of gesture recognition, database of 2160 simple gestures was collected, and recognition procedure was implemented. The main goal was to compare the efficiency of each method assuming that each person should perform the movement naturally. Obtained results suggest that that the most efficient method for the presented problem was the DDTW.

A psychological model of expertise is represented using a series of formally specified and linked XML trees that capture increasing elements of the model, starting with hierarchical structuring, incorporating reasoning with uncertainty, and ending with delivering the final CDSS.  The method was applied to the Galatean Risk and Safety Tool, GRiST, which is a web-based clinical decision support system (www.egrist.org) for assessing mental-health risks. Results of its clinical implementation demonstrate that the method can produce a system that is able to deliver expertise targetted and formatted for specific patient groups, different clinical disciplines, and alternative assessment settings.

For the construction of a membership function (MF) the Zadeh’s Extension Principle (EP)  and mapping of the BMI fuzzy sets into adequate AO fuzzy sets using different transformation functions have been applied. Taking advantage of the results of a screening study, the AO membership functions for adult population of Lodz (WHO-CINDI project) are presented. MF design based on the EP theory is a useful methodology for assessing the AO and, consequently for a better assessment of CMR.

The MDGP is a constraint satisfaction problem and it is generally cast as a continuous global optimization problem. Moreover, under some assumptions, this optimization problem can be discretized and so that it becomes combinatorial, and it can be solved by a Branch &amp; Prune (BP) algorithm. The solution set found by BP, however, can be very large for some instances, while only the most energetically stable conformations are of interest. In this work, we propose and integrate the BP algorithm with two new energy-based pruning devices.

We distinguish multiple types of equal-area facilities (mines, processing and auxiliary facilities). Mines can be placed only on selected locations (deposits of various resources), and the production volume of each type of facility depends on the adjacency of other facilities. We examine two situations: when the number of each type of facility is given, and when only the total number of facilities is specified. The goal is to maximize the production.

In recent years, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have become a very popular tool for Bayesian parameter
estimation. In this case, the problem of finding the best parameters configuration comes to the optimization issue which is to determine the best fit. In this paper, the application of this approach to the classical global optimization problem is described. We consider the situation when optimized functions are dynamical i.e. the global extremum is changing in time. For this purpose, we adapt two dimensional Ackley and four-dimensional Wood functions. Our aim is to find the most probable localization of the extremum in each time with the use of the Bayesian approach joined with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and SMC algorithms.
We propose a mechanism for dynamic tuning of the proposal distribution in SMC. The approach is based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, combined with a resampling mechanism to achieve better results. We have examined different version of the proposed SMC and MCMC algorithms in terms of effectiveness to estimate the probabilistic distributions. The effect is demonstrated using two benchmark optimization problems. Computed results show that the proposed mechanisms can significantly improve optimization results compared to standard MCMC.">Time dependent global optimization via Bayesian inference and Sequential Monte Carlo sampling</a>

The mathematical model of an E. coli fed-batch cultivation process is studied. The three model parameters -- maximum specific growth rate ($\mu_{max}$), saturation constant ($k_{S}$) and yield coefficient ($Y_{S/X}$) are estimated using different population sizes. Population sizes between 5 and 200 chromosomes in the population are tested with constant number of generations. In order to obtain meaningful information about the influence of the population size a considerable number of independent runs of the GA are preformed. The observed results show that the optimal population size is 100 chromosomes for 200 generations. In this case accurate model parameters values are obtained in reasonable computational time. Further increase of the population size, above 100 chromosomes, does not improve the solution accuracy.

In this approach, integration of two environments of mathematical programming (MP) and logic programming (LP) was proposed. In particular, the connection was made between integer programming (IP) and constraint logic programming (CLP). The idea of the proposed approach is to use the strengths of each of the proposed environments for modeling and optimization of the constrained search problems. This is due to the different treatment of the optimization constraints and the method for each of them. This is particularly important for decision models in which there are many constraints summing discrete decision variables, and the objective function is also of similar nature. 
This structure of decision-making models is very common for optimization problems in transportation, distribution, supply chain and manufacturing. For verification and clarification of the proposed approach, two illustrative examples were presented and solved. The first example is the original model devised by the authors, of optimization of integrated supply chain costs. The second one is the known 2E-CVRP benchmark (Two-Echelon Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem).">A hybrid method for modeling and solving constrained search problems</a>

However, system performance and energy consumption are often conflicting objectives.  Algorithms are necessary to help system administrators gain insight into this energy/performance trade-off.  Through the use of intelligent resource allocation techniques, system administrators can examine this tradeoff space to quantify how much a given performance level will cost in electricity, or see what kind of performance can be expected when given an energy budget.  A novel algorithm is presented that efficiently computes tight lower bounds and high quality solutions for energy and makespan.  These solutions are used to bound the Pareto front to easily trade-off energy and performance.  These new algorithms are shown to be highly scalable in terms of solution quality and computation time compared to existing algorithms.">Efficient and Scalable Computation of the Energy and Makespan Pareto Front for Heterogeneous Computing Systems</a>

We consider special types of transfer functions, which are particularly relevant for applications. For concave transfer functions, we reduce the NL-flow problem to the generalized flow problem and solve it using a polynomial-time approximation scheme. For convex, s-shaped and monotonically growing piecewise linear (PWL) transfer functions (the latter can always be divided into s-shaped fragments), we present an equivalent network representation that allows us to build a MILP model with a better performance than if we were using standard MILP formulations of PWL functions. The latter requires additional variables and constraints to force the correct (depending on the amount of flow) linear segment of PWL functions to be taken. In our model, the correct segment in an s-shaped fragment is chosen automatically due to the network&#39;s structure. For the case when transfer functions are non-linear, we provide an error estimation for the approximated solution.">Efficient Models for Special Types of Non-Linear Maximum Flow Problems</a>

In the literature, many hybrid algorithms are proposed in order to achieve a better performance than the well-known evolutionary optimization methods being used alone by combining their features for balancing the exploration and exploitation goals of the optimization algorithms.  This paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm composed of Differential Evolution algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm and Harmony Search algorithm which is called HDPH. The proposed algorithm is compared with these three algorithms on the basis of solution quality and robustness. Numerical results based on several well-studied benchmark functions have shown that HDPH has a good solution quality with high robustness. Also, in HDPH all parameters are randomized which prevents the disadvantage of selecting all possible combination of parameter values in the selected ranges and of finding the best value set by parameter tuning.">A Hybrid Algorithm based on Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimization and Harmony Search Algorithms</a>

The N-body problem chosen is in toroidal 3D space and the bodies are subject only to gravitational forces. In each time step, a large sparse linear system is solved to compute the gravity potential at each nodal point in order to interpolate the solution to each body and through the velocity Verlet method compute the new position, velocity and acceleration of each respective body.

In this paper, we analyze the impact of different configurations of L1 cache on execution of matrix multiplication algorithm for different problem sizes. 
The basis of our research is the existing theoretical analysis of performance drawbacks which appear for matrix multiplication while executed on multicore CPU. We perform series of experiments to analyze the matrix multiplication execution behavior on GPU and its set associative L1 and L2 cache memory with three different configurations: cache size of 16KB, 32KB and 48KB with appropriate set associativity of 4 and 6, respectively.
The results show that only L2 cache impacts the algorithm&#39;s overall performance, particularly the L2 capacity and set associativity. However, the configuration of the L1 cache with 48KB and 6-way set associativity slightly reduces these performance drawbacks, compared to other configurations of L1 with 32KB and 16KB using 4-way cache set associativity, due to greater set associativity.">Performance Impact of Reconfigurable L1 Cache on GPU Devices</a>

The  identification accuracy and the processing time are two key challenges of any cattle identification methodology. This paper presents a robust and fast cattle identification scheme from muzzle print images using local invariant features. The presented scheme compensates some weakness of ear tag and electrical-based traditional identification techniques in terms of accuracy and processing time. The proposed scheme uses Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for detecting the interesting points for image matching. For a robust identification scheme, a Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm has been coupled with the SIFT output to remove the outlier points and achieve more robustness. The experimental evaluations prove the superiority of the presented scheme as it achieves 93.3% identification accuracy in reasonable processing time compared to 90%  identification accuracy achieved by some traditional identification approaches.">A Robust Cattle Identification Scheme Using Muzzle Print Images</a>

The Semantic Web approach helps in making data understandable and processable for both humans and computers by providing common concepts for describing web resources. However, semantic concepts may be also used to improve the process of designing content. In this paper, a new approach to semantic multi-layered design of interactive 3D content is presented. The proposed solution provides a semantic  representation of 3D content in multiple layers reflecting diverse aspects of 3D content.

Therefore we propose to modify this system for fingerprinting where only fixed bits are embedded into the most reliable places of the frequency mask. Systematic linear binary codes with large minimal code distance are used in order to correct errors.

Unfortunately, the data density of color barcodes is substantially limited by the redundancy needed for correcting errors, which are due not only to geometric but also to chromatic distortions introduced by the printing and scanning process.
The higher the expected error rate, the more redundancy is needed for avoiding failures in barcode reading, and thus, the lower the actual data density.
Our work addresses this trade-off between reliability and data density in 2D color barcodes and aims at identifying the most effective algorithms, in terms of byte error rate and computational overhead, for decoding 2D color barcodes.
In particular,  we perform a thorough experimental study to identify the most suitable color classifiers for converting analog barcode cells to digital bit streams.">Color Classifiers for 2D Color Barcodes</a>

Another is to allow the blind who work with notetakers on a daily basis and use common touchscreen-based smartphones and tablets to write using the physical Braille keyboard of a notetaker as well as its editing functions; this would solve many problems encountered and prevent numerous errors made by the blind when using the virtual QWERTY keyboard of a touchscreen-based device.

The implemented services dealt with managing contacts and composing messages – operations that normally require considerable interaction with a QWERTY keyboard.

Studies review shows that common placement tests are far from giving strong predictions and they should be complemented with other metrics, such as high school grades or social factors. Test outcomes show that placement test results per se do not yield enough data to predict student success. However, we discovered it as a quite helpful tool for revealing anomalies at the institutional and methodological level, such as very different outcomes among campuses of the same university, or remarkable difficulty to answer certain questions.

approach  to predict programming aptitude. The existing programming aptitude 
tests rely on the past academic performance of students, on their psychological
features or on a combination of both. The novelty of the proposed approach is
that it attempts to measure student capabilities to manipulate
abstract concepts
that are related with programming, namely time, state and causality.
These concepts were captured in OhBalls - a physical simulation of the path 
taken by a sequence of balls through an apparatus of conveyor belts and levers. 
An engine for this kind of simulation was implemented and deployed as a web 
application, creating a self-contained test that was applied to a cohort 
of first-year undergraduate students to validate the proposed approach.

One of the main reasons is that technology is changing. Due to this fast movement, concepts like “class”, “workgroup” and “learning process” are changing too. Learning processes are going beyond the boundaries of what was known as “class”. Face-to-face models get mixed with online environments where students are remotely connected through the Internet. This new approach is called blended learning, and it is aimed at improving learning as well as bringing learning where it was impossible or complicated. Nevertheless, one of the main issues is that teachers need innovative tools that support these different learning models. As a consequence, this work is focused on the development of a tool for dealing with the main issues found in blended learning scenarios. It is divided in three phases. First, the blended learning experiences and models of the last decade are reviewed. In a second phase, a tool called Drawer, for supporting the main features of the design and use of blended learning experience is developed. In the last phase, an evaluation is made to assess the outcomes of the new tool.">Drawer: an Innovative Teaching Method for Blended Learning</a>

Researchers and scientists are concerned on how to enhance the intrusion detection performance, to be able to deal with real-time attacks and detect them fast from quick response. One way to improve performance is to use minimal number of features to define a model in a way that it can be used to accurately discriminate normal from anomalous behaviour. Many feature selection techniques are out there to reduce feature sets or extract new features out of them. In this paper,  we propose an anomaly detectors generation approach using genetic algorithm in conjunction with several features selection techniques, including principle components analysis, sequential floating, and correlation-based feature selection. A Genetic algorithm was applied with deterministic crowding niching technique, to generate a set of detectors from a single run.  The results  show that sequential-floating techniques with the genetic algorithm have the best results, compared to others tested, especially the sequential floating forward selection with detection accuracy 92.86\% on the train set and 85.38\% on the test set.">Genetic Algorithms with Different Feature Selection Techniques for Anomaly Detectors Generation</a>

Among them, digital entertainment is one of fastest growing networked application domains. Technologies like CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) and HTTP streaming opened the way for new models of TV and video consumption over the Internet. Thanks to emergence of new networking technologies and cooperation paradigms the distinction between traditional TV and the Web is slowly blurring,  creating new category of TV entertainment which is more interactive, delivered over multiple screens and inviting users to participate and collaborate.
This paper presents research on selected social and interactive TV services, focusing on innovations related with incorporation of network interfaces and web protocols. Two use-case scenarios are investigated: one of them explores telco 2.0 interfaces for interactive videos, and the other allows users for social exchanges while watching live sports events. The evaluation results by qualitative user study are presented for the second use-case. A technical architecture is introduced, focused on seamless integration into a typical WebTV platform of telco operator. As important contribution of the paper, some new emerging network protocols and features (like telco 2.0, WebRTC, WebSockets, HTML5 video) are evaluated as potential enabling technologies for future social and interactive TV.">Emerging technologies for interactive TV</a>

Thus, one could argue that the textual password needs to be replaced. One alternative is graphical authentication. A wide range of graphical mechanisms have been proposed in the research literature. Yet, the industry has not embraced these alternatives. We use nowadays (textual) passwords several times a day to mediate access to protected resources and to ensure that accountability is facilitated. Con- sequently, the main aspect of interest to decision-makers is the strength of an authentication mechanism to resist intrusion attempts. Yet, researchers proposing alternative mechanisms have primarily focused on the users’ need for superior usability while the strength of the mechanisms often remains unknown to the decision makers. In this paper we describe a range of graphical authentication mechanisms and consider how much strength they exhibit, in comparison to the textual password. As basic criteria for this comparison, we use the standard guessability, observability and recordability metrics proposed by De Angeli et al. in 2005. The intention of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the potential for graphical mechanisms to be equal to, or superior to, the password in terms of meeting its most basic requirement namely resisting intrusion attempts.">Are Graphical Authentication Mechanisms As Strong As Passwords?</a>

Then, introducing the token into the web form gives the user an access to the desired content. At this exact moment the charging is done. The due amount of money is simply added to the monthly bill, in case of postpaid phones, or subtracted from available credits, in case of prepaid mobile phones.

In this paper we present a survey on these adopted techniques reporting aspects and characteristics of some research studies. Moreover, by means of a comparison grid, we analyze the current state-of-the-art of the approaches of WSN dependability assessment in order to identify the most performant and to discuss the ongoing challenges.">Approaches of Wireless Sensor Network Dependability Assessment</a>

Hierarchization allows for managing model complexity by &quot;hiding&quot; process details into sub-levels. This helps to avoid inconsistencies and fosters reuse of similar parts of models. Configuration, in turn, gives the opportunity to keep different models in one configurable model. In the paper, we propose an approach for configuring Business Processes that relies on hierarchization for more expressive power and simplicity. Our goal is achieved by allowing arbitrary n-to-m relationships between tasks in the merged processes. The approach preserves similar abstraction level of subprocesses in a hierarchy and allows a user to grasp the high-level flow of the merged processes.">A Hierarchical Approach for Configuring Business Processes</a>

Mobile devices are equipped with a variety of sensors and become computationally powerful, which allows for real-time fusion and processing of data gathered by them.
However, most of existing frameworks for context-aware systems, are usually dedicated to static, centralized architectures, and those that were designed for mobile devices, focus mainly on limited resources in terms of CPU and memory, which in nowadays world is no longer a big issue.
Mobile platforms require from the context modelling language and inference engine to be simple and lightweight, but on the other hand -- to be powerful enough to allow not only solving simple context identification tasks but also more complex reasoning.
These, with combination of a large number of sensors and CPU power available on mobile devices result in high energy consumption of a system.
The original contribution of this paper is a proposal of an intelligent middleware for mobile context-aware frameworks, that is able to learn sensor usage habits, and minimize energy consumption of the system.">Learning sensors usage patterns in mobile context-aware systems</a>

All these entities must be efficiently designed and implemented to ensure the practical usage of the theoretically formulated model. The main challenge here is the distributed synchronisation of workflows and locks, that will maximise the performance of the system.

These tools are designed so that it is possible to add extensions that give additional functionality, such as an extension for network evaluation.
Network evaluation is not as popular as Petri Net modeling, but it turns out that, in modeling of some of the problems, network evaluation makes analysis of them very clear and intuitive. Unfortunately there are no mathematical tools and computer programmes, which very much limits the use of network evaluation. Fortunately, under certain assumptions, an evaluation network can be converted into a Petri net. This article presents an idea of how to convert an existing Petri net computer programme to draw evaluation nets and convert them into Petri nets in order to use existing tools for Petri net analysis.
Evaluation nets are well suited for modeling negotiation protocols between two parties represented by servers or software agents. This article provides an example of such a protocol presented in three versions: a sequence diagram UML, Petri net and Evaluation nets.">Using the Evaluation Nets Modeling Tool Concept as an Enhancement of the Petri Net Tool</a>

For this purpose we propose an idealized selecto-Lamarckian model that only features selection and local improvement, and study under which conditions good, high-potential memes can proliferate. We compare population models with panmictic and toroidal grids topology. We show that the increased takeover time induced by the latter is essential to improve the chances for good memes to express themselves in the population by improving their hosts, hence enhancing their survival rates.">Analyzing Meme Propagation in Multimemetic Algorithms: Initial Investigations</a>

Within this paper, a comprehensive overview is given on R&amp;D with relation to CC for logistics. Among these, the EU-project LOGICAL is presented in detail since it combines different aspects and benefits of CC for the logistics sector. A generic system of CC use cases in logistics and the corresponding needs for a logistics cloud architecture are discussed and compared with the implementation status of the LOGICAL cloud. Special attention is given to the problem of incompatible data and service interfaces. Instead of following the single-window, single-document concept, a semi-automated on demand interface creation service is presented as an intermediate alternative for the practitioning logistics sector.">Advancements in Cloud Computing for Logistics</a>

The technique was compared with an Ad-Hoc approach (systemized from the literature) in an experimental study with IT professionals, some new to BPM and some experts; the experts obtained similarly good results with either approach, but the novice professionals obtained better results with PBEC-OTSS than with Ad-Hoc.

Such comparisons assume that both mechanisms produce the same types of outcomes but their values differ. An argument can be made that this is not necessarily the case. Based on several experiments of multi-attribute auctions and two formats of multi-bilateral negotiations the paper argues that the two mechanisms produce some outcomes which are comparable and other outcomes which are qualitatively different. A surprising finding of our experiments is that the outcomes of the non-verifiable negotiations were more similar to the outcomes of the reverse auctions than to the verifiable negotiations, despite the fact that the latter employ rules taken from the auction mechanism.">Multi-attribute Auctions and Negotiations with Verifiable and Not-verifiable Offers</a>

Application of formal methods in this field necessities in overcoming several problems. Firstly, business analyst and designers rarely have enough skills and motivation to manually build abstract and formal specifications, hence, it arises the need to provide tools for an automated translation of business models into a suitable form ready for formal verification. Moreover, notations and languages used to describe enterprises usually have no clear semantics. Finally, the verification itself must be supported by an efficient tool. In this paper we investigate an application of formal and deduction-based techniques to automated verification of behavioral description embedded within ArchiMate models. We describe a set of rules that governs translation of processes specified in ArchiMate language into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. The translation step is achieved with the developed software, as a plugin into a popular the Archi modeler. Formal verification of a business process properties is achieved with another tool,  the LTL prover based on the semantic tableaux technique. Application of the method is discussed on a small, yet illustrative, example of a taxi service.">Verification of ArchiMate process specifications based on deductive temporal reasoning</a>

Horizon scanning can use the Web to augment the acquisition of information, though this involves a search for novel and emerging issues without knowing them beforehand. To optimise such a search, we propose the use of relevance feedback, which involves human interaction in the retrieval process so as to improve results. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we have carried out a horizon scanning exercise suggested by RAL Space. Our implementation of relevance feedback was able to maintain the retrieval of relevant documents constant over the length of the experiment, without any decrements, which represents an improvement over previous studies where relevance feedback was not considered.">Optimising Web-Based Information Retrieval Methods for Horizon Scanning Using Relevance Feedback</a>

It reduces the operating efficiency of the chain and blocks the operating resources. Some of the common causes of BWE are demand order variations, long lead times, competence defects between supply chain links, lack of communication among links in the chain, etc. There have been efforts to overcome these issues. However, very little work has been reported based on formal representation and analysis of resource flow in the supply chain system. In this work, a novel framework is proposed using Generalized Stochastic Petri-net (GSPN) model towards handling this issue in a distributed scenario. The analysis on the stochastic nets allows identifying the bottlenecks in the supply chain echelons along with customer relationship management (CRM). This has been used to rebuild infrastructure with the end-objective of reducing the BWE.">Modeling the Bullwhip Effect in a Multi-Stage Multi-Tier Retail Network by Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets</a>

However, a common understanding of what agility means and what it consists of is missing. Until today, a lot of frameworks have been developed, but they are very heterogeneous regarding content and structure. This paper approaches that issue by conducting a systematic comparison of 28 available agility frameworks out of the domains of agile manufacturing, agile software development, agile organization, and agile workforce. Altogether, 33 concepts related to agility were identified. The results of the comparison show that even within the examined specific domains a lack of consensus is obvious. In addition, the utilized concepts are very ambigious and overlapping. So, the interdependencies between the identified concepts were analyzed in detail. This revealed five recurring “clusters” that each combine several concepts with similar content, but despite the amount of available frameworks, none of it reflects these clusters directly. Hence, the study shows that the factors beyond the construct of agility are not fully uncovered yet.">The Structure of Agility from Different Perspectives</a>

We consider horizontal cooperation among suppliers such that they can swap their orders to reduce their transportation cost, and they can purchase products from each other to reduce their shortage cost. Hence, the objective is to examine the potential swap and horizontal purchasing operations between suppliers under perfect information sharing. Assuming a balanced network in a single-period, in which total capacity of suppliers is greater than or equal to the total demand of customers, we conduct an empirical analysis for six suppliers and eight customers. The analysis suggests for many suppliers the benefits of order swapping and lateral purchasing.">Product Swapping and Transfer Sales Between Suppliers in a Balanced Network</a>

Majority of the authors apply the method of  multi-criteria evaluation for selection of suppliers, mainly the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) algorithm and related ones, to find its solution. In this paper it has been proved that a suitably expressive system of rules management can be used as an effective tool for suppliers evaluation. In the presented work we have applied the Rebit system which was elaborated by the AGH University of Science and Technology. An example of evaluation of a supplier of primary charging materials for metal processing enterprise has been presented.

The data may be utilized by the decision support systems in logistics; nevertheless, often there is an information integration problem. The information interchange issues are related to incompatible information interchange issues cross independently designed data systems. The networked supply chains will need appropriate IT architectures to support the cooperating business units utilizing structured and unstructured big data and the mechanisms to integrate data in heterogeneous supply chains. In this paper we analyze the capabilities of the big data technology architectures with cloud computing under usage of Linked Data in business process management in supply chains to cope with unstructured near-time data and data silos problems. We present our approach on a 4PL (Fourth-party Logistics) integrator business process example.">Applying Big Data and Linked Data Concepts in Supply Chains Management</a>

In this approach, integration of two environments of mathematical programming (MP) and logic programming (LP) was proposed. In particular, the connection was made between integer programming (IP) and constraint logic programming (CLP). The idea of the proposed approach is to use the strengths of each of the proposed environments for modeling and optimization of the supply chain issues. This is due to the different treatment of the optimization constraints and the method for each of them. This is particularly important for models in which there are many constraints summing discrete decision variables, and the objective function is also of similar nature. In order to verify the proposed approach, the optimization models and their implementation in traditional mathematical programming and hybrid environments were presented.">A hybrid approach to supply chain modeling and optimization</a>

Traditionally, it was often perceived as indication of invalid data or behavior and as such should be avoided or eliminated. However, there are also numerous situations where inconsistency is a natural phenomena or carry useful information. In order to decide how to manage inconsistent knowledge, it is thus important to recognize its origin, aspect
and influence on the behavior of the system. In this paper, we analyze a case of collaborative knowledge management with
hybrid knowledge representation. This serves as a starting point for a discussion about various types of inconsistencies and
approaches to handle it. We analyze sources, interpretation and possible approaches to identified types of inconsistencies. We

Several substantial studies on this observable fact have been undertaken with focus primarily aimed at the large corporations and the small to medium sized organizations. This vulnerability is however evermore present and significant within the smaller of businesses. In the micro enterprise, the impact of corporate amnesia is realized when even a single member of staff is absent for any lengthy period of time or vacates their post altogether.  Although 80% of the workforce in major economies is directly engaged within the micro enterprise business, minimal research has addressed such a commercial model albeit the fact that the competitive benefits that can potentially be realized by addressing corporate amnesia are significant.  To this end, this paper will identify the main causes of corporate amnesia within the micro business environment and propose a suitable framework for the enterprise to effectively facilitate the adoption of Knowledge Management and realize the associated competitive benefits.">Corporate Amnesia in the Micro Business Environment</a>

Very frequently activities of organizations are dependent on the application of knowledge, sometimes even means &quot;to be or not to be&quot; for enterprise. Nowadays, to fulfill business goals of institutions it becomes fundamental for them to use intelligent systems supporting comprehensive management of the organization. Such support allows to increase efficiency and better effectiveness of the running businesses. As we are living in age of international integration, where world economy is tending to reach type of knowledge-based economy (KBE), universities are forced also to change way of their functioning. It is important for modern universities to be not only education centers but mainly the successfully prospering organizations-based-on-knowledge. Such approach is going to provide higher competitiveness of particular institution and will make its functioning more useful for economy of the region. Implementing a comprehensive and intelligent IT solution within a university and providing educational services, which are personalized to the needs of the market, will allow universities to reach a type of institution called “smart”. The aim of the paper is explanation why university centers should evolve in a type of institution based on knowledge. The paper is managed as follows. After short introduction concerning research context the discussed concepts of Knowledge Management and Smart Universities are presented. In the main section real examples of Knowledge Management Systems implementation and examples of Smart Universities are investigated in order to identify and describe roles of Knowledge Management Systems in this area.

Automatically generating tests from specified properties of the system using the tool QuickCheck provides professional developers with the required test efficiency. But how good is the quality of these automatically generated tests? Do they cover the cases that one would have written in manual tests? The quality depends on the specified properties and data generators and so far there has not been an objective way to evaluate the quality of these QuickCheck generators.

This work argues that to effectively cope with the fundamental correctness issues of such systems, the use of formal tools is mandatory so as to avoid misuse of the synchronization primitives which can easily lead to well-known problems of deadlock, starvation and so forth. This paper proposes an original approach to modeling and exhaustive verification of Java-based concurrent systems which relies on the popular UPPAAL model checker. More precisely, a library of UPPAAL timed automata (TA) reproducing the semantics of major Java concurrent and synchronization mechanisms, was developed. All of this fosters a modeling process driven by implementation aspects, thus favoring a smooth transition from specification down to implementation. The library includes such common control structures like semaphores and monitors, both classic and Java specific. The paper describes the developed TA library and shows its practical use by means of examples. Finally, an indication of on-going and future work directions is drawn in the conclusions.">Modelling Java Concurrency: An Approach and a Uppaal Library</a>

For this reason, once a hybrid model of the system has been proved to be correct with respect to the desired properties, it would be valuable to derive a correct-by-construction implementable control strategy for such a model.
This work discusses a new methodology and a corresponding tool-chain that allows to synthesize an implementable control strategy for the class of hybrid automata named Lazy Linear Hybrid Automata (LLHA).

Generally, safety impacts the system’s environment while environment impacts security of a CPS. Very frequently, safety and security of a CPS interact with each other either synergistically or conflictingly. Therefore, a combined evaluation of safety and security that considers their interrelationships is required for proper assessment of a CPS. Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) can be used for this evaluation where factors related to safety and security of a CPS are assumed to be randomly distributed. The result of this evaluation is an assessment that is non-deterministic in nature but gives a very good approximation of the actual extent of safety and security in a CPS.  Using a case study of a SCADA based system in an oil pipeline control, the authors developed a BBN approach for assessing mutual impacts of security and safety violations. This approach is compared with the Non-Functional requirements approach (NFR), used previously, which is largely qualitative in nature. This study demonstrates that BBN approach can significantly complement other techniques for joint assessment of safety and security in CPS.">Studying Interrelationships of Safety and Security for Software Assurance in Cyber-Physical Systems: Approach Based on Bayesian Belief Networks</a>

Due to the combination of discrete and continuous dynamics, most verification problems are undecidable and need to be
dealt with by various kinds abstraction techniques.
As systems grow larger and larger, most verification problems are difficult even for purely discrete systems.
One way to address this problem is the use of interactive verification.
Recently, this approach has also been considered by cyber-physical verification tools like KeYmaera and
other classical theorem provers.

Important requirements for the interactive verification are a precise and readable modeling language as well as the
possibility to decompose the system into smaller subsystems.
Here, tools like  KeYmaera and PVS still need further improvement.
On the other hand, these modeling aspects are both addressed within the language Quartz as it provides a complete
programming language for cyber-physical systems with standard data types and programming statements as well as a
precise compositional semantics that is well-suited for compositional verification.

In this paper, we take the advantages of two different tools, the Averest system and KeYmaera, for the interactive
verification of cyber-physical systems.
This way, we combine modeling and verification capabilities of Averest and the verification capability of KeYmaera, in
order to provide a basis for powerful tool set for the interactive verification of cyber-physical systems.

In this paper, we present an Alf specialization that introduces the synchronous-reactive model of computation to SysML, through definition of not explicitly constrained semantics: timing, concurrency, and inter-object communication. The proposed specialization is well-suited for safety-critical systems because it is deterministic. We study one example already modeled in the literature, to compare these approaches with our one. The initial results show that the proposed specialization helps to couple complexity, provides better composition, and enables deterministic behavior definition.">Towards the Applicability of Alf to Model Cyber-Physical Systems</a>

Processing such data stored in relational databases is not straightforward, since the relational algebra and calculus do not provide adequate facilities. 
Therefore, it is not surprising that a number of initial SQL standards do not contain recursion as well.
Although it was introduced by SQL:1999, even now it is implemented in few selected database management systems. 
In particular, one of the most popular DBMSs (MySQL) does support recursive queries yet. 
Numerous classes of queries can be accelerated using redundant data structures. 
Recursive queries form such a class. 
In this paper we consider four materialization solutions that speed up recursive queries. 
Three of them belong to the state-of-the-art, while the fourth one is the contribution of this paper. 
The latter method assures that the required redundant storage is linearithmic. 
The other methods do not guarantee such a limitation.
We also present thorough experimental evaluation of all these solutions using data of various sizes up to million records.
Since all these methods require writing complex code if applied directly, we have prototyped an integration of them into Hibernate object-relational mapping system. 
This way all the peculiarities are hidden from application developers. 
Architects can simply choose the appropriate materialization method and record their decisions in configuration files. 
All necessary routines and storage objects are then generated automatically by the ORM layer.">On Redundant Data for Faster Recursive Querying Via ORM Systems</a>

The amount of available information can vary from instance to instance and can be collected incrementally. It can happen that there exists no class suitable for all known attributes and so even movement of the instance to another class can be complicated. We can create exhaustive number of classes to cover all predicted variants, but still some other combinations of data can occur. To solve this situation, appearing often during processing of heterogeneous and mutable data, the model of relaxed objects was invented. It is based on the idea that object classes should be defined loosely in form of conditions - presumptions on data content or availability - and that instances should belong implicitly to all classes that are currently met. 
Methods associated with such classes assure that each instance is provided by all currently executable methods and its behavior change dynamically with changes of its content. The paper describes the Java-based object interface for this model, its effectivity, and the domain index suitable for efficient data searching.">Java Interface for Relaxed Object Storage</a>

Magnify is our new tool that performs static analysis and visualization of software. It parses the source code, identifies dependencies between code units and records all the collected information in a repository based on a language-independent graph-based data model. Nodes of the graph correspond to program entities of disparate granularity: methods, classes, packages etc.  Edges represent dependencies and hierarchical structure. We use colours to reflect the quality, sizes to display the importance of artefacts, density of connections to portray the coupling. This kind of visualization gives bird&#39;s-eye view of the source code.

To understand the unified refactoring process, this paper also provides a brief insight into grammar refactoring operators, providing universal

It performs an application recovery from binary executable files back into the high level language (HLL) representation. One of its critical tasks is to produce an accurate and well-readable code. However, this is a challenging task since the executable code may be produced by one of the modern compilers that use advanced optimizations. One type of such an optimization is usage of so-called instruction idioms. These idioms are used to produce faster or even smaller executable files. On the other hand, decompilation of instruction idioms without any advanced analysis produces almost unreadable HLL code that may confuse the user of a decompiler. In this paper, we present a method of instruction-idioms detection and reconstruction back into a readable form with the same meaning. This approach is adapted in an existing retargetable decompiler developed within the Lissom project. The implementation has been tested on several modern compilers and target architectures. According to our experimental results, the proposed solution is highly accurate on the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor families, but it should be further improved on the CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architectures.">Reconstruction of Instruction Idioms in a Retargetable Decompiler</a>

The same applies for domain specific languages, whose popularity is increasing and there is a need for aid in their design process. This paper analyses the problem of identifiers and references in computer languages. Current methods use an imperative approach for supporting references in languages; therefore a language designer is required to manually write reference resolving. The method proposed in this paper perceives references and identifiers as language patterns, which can be specified in a declarative manner with much less knowledge about the problem of resolving references in computer languages.">Declarative Specification of References in DSLs</a>

However, both the creation and use of template libraries is hindered by the fact that the language does not allow programmers to specify constraints on generic types. To date, no proposal to update the language to provide concepts has survived the committee process. Until that time comes, as a form of early support, this paper introduces SimpleConcepts, an extension to C++11 that provides support for concepts, sets of constraints on generic types. SimpleConcepts features are parsed according to an island grammar and source-to-source translation is used to lower concepts to pure C++11 code.">SimpleConcepts: Support for Constraints on Generic Types in C++</a>

A concrete structure can help in certain situations with the program understanding. Therefore we propose using dynamic structuring that allows assigning multiple structures to one source code to aid program comprehension. Concern-oriented source code projections facilitate this dynamic structuring expressed by custom metadata and provide multiple views of the source code that reflect logical structures provided by the dynamic structuring. This way in a specific situation a programmer can get a structure (by a view) that meets his/her current needs the best.">Concern-oriented Source Code Projections</a>

We focus on the role of the programming language used for an introductory course.  For this purpose we propose CAL, a C-like algorithmic language, which is essentially a well-defined and behaved subset of C with a small number of modest, &quot;educational&quot; extensions.  We present the design rationale for CAL, its main features, syntax and illustrative examples.">Teaching Programming through Problem Solving: The Role of the Programming Language</a>

This semantics, which coincides with the denotational semantics for nQML over density matrices and unitary transformations, serves as a compiler from nQML programs to quantum circuits.  We also provide an implementation of this compiler, written in Haskell, as well as an interpreter for quantum circuits.">Compilation to Quantum Circuits for a Language with Quantum Data and Control</a>

According to the resulting grammar-driven development approach, JSON processing applications are architected as syntax-directed translators. Thus, the core part of these components can be described in terms of translation schemata and can be automatically generated by using suitable parser generators. It makes it possible to specify critical parts of the application (those interfacing with JSON documents) by using high-level, grammar-oriented descriptions, as well as to promote the separation of JSON processing concerns from other application-specific aspects. In consequence, the production and maintenance of JSON processing applications is facilitated (especially for applications involving JSON documents with intricate nested structures, as well as for applications in which JSON formats are exposed to frequent changes and evolutions in their surface structures). This paper illustrates the approach with JSON-P as the generic JSON processing framework, with ANTLR as the parser generation tool, and with a case study concerning the development of a player for simple man-machine dialogs shaped in terms of JSON documents.">Grammar-Driven Development of JSON Processing Applications</a>

design problems.
They also facilitate writing robust and readable code.
Their usage happens to be particularly profitable if the documentation
of the resulting system is lost, inaccurate or out of date.
In reverse engineering, detection of instances of design patterns is
extremely helpful as it aids grasping high level design ideas.
However, the actual instances of design patterns can diverge from
their canonical textbook templates.
Useful pattern detection tools should thus be able to identify not
only orthodox implementations but also their disparate variants.
In this paper, we present a method to generate queries to detect
canonical instances of design patters.
Next, we show a systematic technique to relax these queries so that
they also cover variant implementations of patterns.
we discuss our proof-of-concept implementation of this approach in our
prototype tool D-CUBED.
Finally, we also report the results of an experimental comparison of
D-CUBED and state-of-the-art detectors.">Relaxing Queries to Detect Variants of Design Patterns</a>

Researchers have proposed different security mechanisms to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of logs. However, applying current secure logging schemes on heterogeneous formats of logs is tedious. Here, we propose FAL, a domain-specific language (DSL) through which we can apply a secure logging mechanism on any format of logs. Using FAL, we can define log structure, which represents the format of logs and ensures the security properties of a chosen secure logging scheme. This log structure can be later used by FAL to serve two purposes: it can be used to store system logs securely, and it will help application developers for secure application logging by generating required source code.">FAL: A Forensics Aware Language for Secure Logging</a>

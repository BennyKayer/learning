## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
smaller <- diamonds %>%
  filter(carat < 3)

ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy))

diamonds %>%
  count(color, cut) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
  geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
# read in files
# right click csv and import
# data.csv creates object data

preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes", NA, 10,
  "no", 20, 12
)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(datapasta)
# paste in data as tribble
library(esquisse)
# make cool ggplots
library(rayshader)
# ray shaded graphics
```

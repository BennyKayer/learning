The problem ⚡
Even though this would work just fine for most of the users, there is a huge problem when it comes to accessibility here. The button will not be marked as linking to another page at all, which makes it nearly impossible to be identified by screen readers. Also could you open that in a new tab or window? Most likely not.

The solution ✅
Linking to other pages with any user interaction should, where possible, be handled by the <Link> component or a normal <a> tag.
